//  This program was created by Abdalla Atalla and finished on 11/22/19. This program is a game where the user has to pick a chip from a bag and the chip will be either a digit or strike. There are three strikes allowed until you lose the game. If its a digit then guess which position it belongs to in the car's price. Have fun!
